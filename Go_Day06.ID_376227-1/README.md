- Your programs should not exit unexpectedly (give an error on valid input). If this happens, your project will be considered non-functional and will receive a 0 in the evaluation.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project, even though this work doesn't have to be submitted and won't be graded. This will allow you to easily test your work and the work of your peers. You will find these tests particularly useful during your defense. In fact, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating during your defense.
- Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be evaluated.
- If your code uses external dependencies, it should use [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules) to manage them.

- You should only submit `*.go` files and (in case of external dependencies) `go.mod` + `go.sum`.
- Your code for this task should be buildable with just `go build`.
- Additional steps, e.g. for creating tables in a database, should be included in *admin_credentials.txt*.

So â€” this is it! You just got superpowers! And as a new superhero, you definitely need to think about your street cred and overall recognition, don't you think?

Fireballs â€” check!
Almost indecently tight leotard â€” check!
Secret base â€” oh yeah, baby!

Anything else you forgot? Any other shenanigans to perform? OH WAIT~

<h2 id="chapter-iv" >Chapter IV</h2>
<h3 id="ex00">Exercise 00: Amazing Logo</h3>

The only requirement here is to create an amazing logo! It should be a 300x300px PNG file named 'amazing_logo.png'. Make it as cool as possible!

The image should appear in the same directory as the launched binary executable after compilation.

NOTE: You shouldn't cheat and download anything from the Internet into your code. Just don't rely on any external sources and use your imagination in programming! Also, just plain single color or transparent logo doesn't count!

<h2 id="chapter-v" >Chapter V</h2>
<h3 id="ex01">Exercise 01: Place for Your Thoughts</h3>

Okay, so what else do you need? A website, of course! It should be a blog where everyone can read your ideas for improving the world. Here is a list of features it should have:

- Database (you should use PostgreSQL);
- Admin panel (on '/admin' endpoint) where only you can log in, with just a form to post new articles (let's forget about editing old ones for now, superheroes never look back);
- Basic markdown support (so it can at least show "###" headers and links in generated HTML);
- Pagination (show no more than 3 thoughts on a page, so people don't get too much of your awesomeness);
- Application UI should use port 8888.
Any additional files (images, css, js, if you decide to use any of those) should be submitted as a *zip* file to be unpacked in the same directory as the binary itself, resulting in something like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.css
â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ my_cat.png
â”œâ”€â”€ js
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ scripts.js
â””â”€â”€ myblog-binary
```

Admin credentials for posting access (login and password) and database credentials (database name and user) should also be provided separately in a file called *admin_credentials.txt*. If there are additional commands that need to be executed to create tables in a database, put them in the same file.

The main page should contain your logo from EX00, links to articles and (optionally) a short preview of their content, as well as pagination (if there are more than 3 articles in a database).

When clicking on a link to an article, the user should be taken to a page with rendered markdown text and a single "back" link that takes him/her back to the main page.

Now, if you already have a cool site, let's update it a little and protect ourselves from the bad guys trying to bring it down! All you need to do is implement rate limiting, so if more than a hundred clients per second try to access it, they should get a "429 Too Many Requests" response. Of course, as you get more popular, we'll increase the limit! For now, it's just for testing.
